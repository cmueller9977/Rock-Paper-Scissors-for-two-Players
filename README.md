# Rock Paper Scissors for two Players
 Practicing Python fundamentals

At the moment I am on my way to learn Python using the book "Automate the boring stuff"

You can find it here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

To practice the different topics I always try to find ideas to put them into a kind of a small project. In this case it's about the Flowcontrol and the basics - end of chapter two.

In the book the author is also using a Rock Paper Scissors game to demonstrate the Flowcontrol.
To get more practice I came up with the idea to expand it for two players.

Maybe I will go on with that little game later and fork it with different ideas.
